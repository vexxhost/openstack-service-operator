              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
              may reject unrecognized values.

                  Availability indicates to whom a specific service endpoint is accessible:
                  the internet at large, internal networks only, or only to administrators.
                  Different identity services use different terminology for these. Identity v2
                  lists them as different kinds of URLs within the service catalog ("adminURL",
                  "internalURL", and "publicURL"), while v3 lists them as "Interfaces" in an
                  endpoint's response.
